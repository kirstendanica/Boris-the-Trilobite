      <p>Greetings, mortals of the Holocene Epoch. My name is Boris. I'm a trilobite. Trilobites are extinct marine
        arthropods
        that first appeared over 500 million years ago. To put it simply, I am a dead bug - a very old dead bug.
        Psh, just because I'm <em>now</em> doesn't mean that "my people" weren't one of the most successful animal
        groups to ever exist.</p>

      <p>Just for comparison's sake:
        Homo sapiens (you humans) have been around for approximately 300,000 years.
        The human's typical favorite prehistoric creature, the dinosaur, survived for around 165 million years.
        Us trilobites had the pleasure of living on this planet for nearly <em>300 million years.</p></em>
      </p>
      <p>We were also one of the most diverse creatures: over 20,000 different species, and that's just what has been
        found by you mortals!
        Speaking of species, I'm an Asaphus kowalewskii trilobite. I try not to be bias of my kind, but it's very
        difficult
        when you're perhaps the first animal to have seen the moon (look at my eyes!) More on that can be found
        over <a href="./pages/trilobites.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Welcome, mortal. While you're having a look around my website, please do make yourself at home!
        ...But not too at home, you never know when your <a href="#.">Permian extinction</a> will come. Heh.</p>
