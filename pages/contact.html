            <p>My name is Kirsten, and I'm the mind behind Boris & his little website.</p>
            <p>Some random information about me:</p>
            <div class="information-box">
                <ul class="info-scroll">
                    <li>I've always loved roly-poly bugs (pill bugs) and thought they were
                        so cool / cute. I suspect this is what attracted me to trilobites right away!
                    </li>
                    <li>When I was little, I wanted to create a video game so badly and learn how to do it,
                        but I was discouraged by being told that it "involved a lot of math and hard stuff" -
                        now that I've gotten so into web development and learning more and more, I have no fear of one
                        day
                        making that game one day. ☺
                    </li>
                    <li>My career started off as an English teacher because my best subject in school was always English
                        / Language
                        Arts, and I really wanted to travel to teach English in Saint-Petersburg, Russia (I did!)
                    </li>
                    <li>When I'd first learned about paleontology and natural history as a child, I thought it would be
                        a cool idea
                        to draw pictures of dinosaurs / ancient marine reptiles / etc. & sent these drawings around my
                        neighborhood ..
                        why? I have no idea, maybe I wanted people to be 'reminded' of what was here before? ☺
                    </li>
                    <li>My favorite ancient animal (besides the trilobite) is plesiosaur, and I actually have a tattoo
                        of a plesiosaur!</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Relating to the point above regarding creating a video game, I've always been super artistic and
                        I have been
                        drawing since I could pick up a writing utensil. I stopped for a long time while pursuing and a
                        bit during my
                        teaching career, because I was discouraged from creating after feeling like I had no 'purpose'
                        for my art.
                    </li>
                    <li>I started drawing trilobites a lot when I left Russia in 2022 because of the war. I had to abandon most of
                        my fossils with friends for the time being, and I wanted to maintain my connection to the community that I was apart of without having
                        any new trilobite fossils to gush over. With nothing but a backpack, art stuff and 2 of my favorite trilobite fossils, I just started to draw them!
                    </li>
                </ul>
