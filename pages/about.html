            <span>I came up with the idea to create "Boris the Trilobite" for several reasons.</span>
            <ol>
                <li>A love for animals, all animals, and paleontology. My all-time favorite is, of course, the
                    trilobite!</li>
                <li>While studying web development, I knew that my ultimate personal project would be related to my
                    hobby.</li>
                <li>Transitioning careers from a teacher to a developer, I couldn't help but want to share information
                    and educate
                    others on this slightly obscure topic that I love so much.</li>

            <p><strong>Why trilobites? An entire website dedicated to them?</p></strong>
            <img class="about-img" src="/resources/images/about-img.jpg" alt="trilobite about photo">
            <p>Trilobites are, simply put, one of the most successful creatures in the history
                of Earth. If you gain an interest in paleontology or geology beyond the dinosaurs (though they're
                amazing too!)
                you will most likely spot a trilobite fossil quite quickly.
                These creatures evolved at a rapid speed, distributing themselves all across
                the world in great variety and abundance.

            </p>
            <p>I'd always dreamed of a world where a concept like the Pokemon game was real. As a child, I practically
                lived by the motto "Gotta catch 'em all!" It got to the point where I can clearly remember writing to
                scientists
                before the age of 11 or so, via email, asking them to "make Pokemon real." What can I say?
                I loved the idea of a certain type of creature that came in all kinds of shapes and sizes, behaviors,
                color patterns,
                found in different areas of the world ... Enter: the trilobite. As Boris states in the <a
                    href="../index.html">homepage</a>,
                with over 20,000 species, it truly would be a life goal to "catch 'em all," in their current fossilized
                form, of course...
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to entertain while educating. All artwork is done by <a
                    href="./contact.html">myself</a>
                and the entire website has been created by me as well. This website is, firstly, a personal project
                created for my own enjoyment and
                web development skill growth. Whoever happens to enjoy this website, laugh a bit, learn a little bit of
                something new along the way - that is the
                ultimate <em>purpose.</em></p>
