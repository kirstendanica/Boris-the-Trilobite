            <p>Trilobites are, simply put, one of the most successful creatures in the history
                of Earth. If you gain an interest in paleontology or geology beyond the dinosaurs (though they're
                amazing too!)
                you will most likely spot a trilobite fossil quite quickly. They are oftentimes overlooked by the general public as they
                don't necessarily fit the image, on first glance at least, as an incredible prehistoric creature. And, to be quite
                frank? 
                <br>
                <br>Well, they're... bugs. 
                <br>
                <br>Sure, you can hear people discussing how big and intimidating bugs of the past were when
                speaking about giant cockroaches or massive centipedes, but in my experience, that is usually the extent of it. 
                Nobody really considers the 'granddaddy bug', the OG, the bug that came <em>before</em> the bugs we know today.
                <br>
                <br><span class="why-span">Enter: the Trilobite</span>
                <br>One of the earliest known groups of arthropods (bugs!) evolved at a rapid speed, distributing themselves all across
                the world in great variety and abundance.

            <p>I'd always dreamed of a world where a concept like the Pokemon game was real. As a child, I practically
                lived by the motto "Gotta catch 'em all!" It got to the point where I can clearly remember writing to
                scientists
                before the age of 11 or so, via email, asking them to "make Pokemon real." What can I say?
                I loved the idea of a certain type of creature that came in all kinds of shapes and sizes, behaviors,
                color patterns,
                found in different areas of the world ... Enter: the trilobite. As Boris states in the <a
                    href="../index.html">homepage</a>,
                with over 20,000 species, it truly would be a life goal to "catch 'em all," in their current fossilized
                form, of course...

            <p>The purpose of this website is to entertain while educating. All artwork is done by <a
                    href="./contact.html">myself</a>
                and the entire website has been created by me as well. This website is, firstly, a personal project
                created for my own enjoyment and
                web development skill growth. Whoever happens to enjoy this website, laugh a bit, learn a little bit of
                something new along the way - that is the
                ultimate <em>purpose.</em></p>
