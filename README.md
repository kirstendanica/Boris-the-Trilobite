# Boris the Trilobite

## Intro

This website is a personal project dedicated to my paleontology hobby / love of trilobites.
It is a mashup of education and entertainment, as the website is partially 'created by an extinct bug' with his 'point of view.'
Obviously, that part is fictional, but it's part of what makes the educational aspect entertaining!
